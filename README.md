## Group 7 Members:
* Ismail Zakaria
* Liu Patrick
* Nguyen Trong
* Elmokdad Hussein
* Ngo Huu Gia Bao

## Requirements & Dependencies

* Java JDK-17 or later version
* JUnit 4 for unit testing

No other external dependencies required.

## Compiling & Running the Application

Note that this application was built on Eclipse IDE release version 4.26.0. using Window 10 OS.

Download and extract the .zip file. Then import the source code directly and 
run the program in local IDE, otherwise the program can be compiled and 
executed via Command Prompt. Note that each program requires its own 
terminal. In other words, it must be able to run multiple main programs 
(projects) concurrently.

Navigate to `/src/main/Main.java` and run the `main` method.
